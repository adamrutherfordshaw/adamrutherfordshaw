# Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Adam

I'm a front end software developer based near Manchester, UK.

## What do you do?

As a front end developer, my primary focus is on building fast and accessible user interfaces. I focus most of my efforts into my full-time career, trying to spend most of my spare time taking a healthy break away from the screen ðŸ’» - which is why you might not see loads going on round these parts.

## What tools do you use?

I have experience with wide range of technologies and frameworks, including React, Next, TypeScript, Node, GraphQL, and more.

In my day-to-day role, I mostly use React and TypeScript, although I do enjoy using Kotlin and Spring in some back end projects too.

## How do I contact you?

If you'd like to contact me, for whatever reason, then you can send me an email to [hello@adamrutherford.dev](mailto:hello@adamrutherford.dev) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamrutherfordshaw).

You might see my name in other parts of the internet but I don't tend to hang round there anymore.
